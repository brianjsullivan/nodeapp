NODE JS is built on Google v8 JavaScript engine & leverages JavaScript on the server
---
Node is asynchronous & runs on a SINGLE THREAD
  -> opposed to PHP/Ruby/ASP which are multi-thread
  -> single-thread doesn't have to wait on a synchronous or long-running task
  -> an event queue receives incomplete operations and executes them separately, while node remains open to new requests and operations

"When a web request comes in it is passed off to an ASYNCHRONOUS CALLBACK HANDLER and frees up the main thread allowing the next process to happen"
  -> this is unlike PHP & other server-side language, which operate synchronously
  -> Synchronous code may block new requests

---
NPM is ran in the command line and manages dependencies

Basic commands:
  -> npm install packagename
  -> npm update packagename
  -> npm ls (show what's on your system)
  -> npm ls installed (view installed packages)
  -> npm ls installed packagename (find if a specific package or author is installed)
  -> npm link (symlink a package folder; related to building modules)
  -> npm search

Updating Node.js via NPM:
  -> npm cache clean -f
  -> npm install -g n (-g means global)
  -> n stable
  "n" represents a node helper and updates node to the most recent stable version
